# Optional dependencies for enhanced functionality
# =================================================
# Install with: pip install -r requirements-optional.txt

# Chat transcript export with advanced formatting and styling
# Used by: apex_core/storage.py for enhanced transcript generation
chat-exporter>=2.8.0,<3.0.0

# AWS S3 storage for transcript archival
# Used by: apex_core/storage.py for cloud backup of transcripts
# Note: boto3 has frequent updates, upper bound may need adjustment
boto3>=1.34.0,<2.0.0

# Security Notes
# ==============
# boto3 updates frequently with AWS service additions
# Safe to update within 1.x range
# Always test S3 upload functionality after updating boto3

# Usage
# =====
# These dependencies are optional and the bot will work without them:
# - Without chat-exporter: Basic text-only transcripts will be used
# - Without boto3: Transcripts will be stored locally only (no S3 backup)
#
# Install selectively:
#   pip install chat-exporter  # For better transcripts only
#   pip install boto3          # For S3 storage only
#   pip install -r requirements-optional.txt  # For all optional features
